## PSE Edge Parser

This is a Java application which parses data from the PSE Edge website for further analysis of stock prices and price properties.

It produces an excel file containing a list of stocks which are within a set range (say 5 percent) from its 52-week low.

The application only processes the latest stock information published from PSE Edge and does not look into historical stock data.
